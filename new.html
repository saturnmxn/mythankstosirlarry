          <br />
          After 3 years with you, I only have realized now how much I will actually miss you and your way of teaching. 
          Thank you for everything sir, thank you for accepting me not only as a student or a player, but also as a friend. 
          I promise to not only use your teachings in my academics but also in my daily life. I am looking forward to our
          next ft sir! I promise to not be a stranger during my shs life, I will make sure that I will still go back to you not 
          just as a past teacher but also as my mentor and a friend. Thanks for everything sir Larry!
